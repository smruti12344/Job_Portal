## Features

- **Multithreading**: Demonstrates the use of Java's multithreading capabilities for concurrent processing.
- **Networking**: Includes client-server architecture and demonstrates how to handle network communication.
- **Database Integration**: Integrates with a MySQL database to perform CRUD operations and other data management tasks.
- **REST API**: Provides an API for external applications to interact with the system.
- **User Authentication**: Implements user authentication and authorization features.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 11+**
- **Apache Tomcat 9.0** for server deployment and management.
- **Maven** for build and dependency management.
- **MySQL** as the relational database.
- **RESTful APIs** for providing services.
- **JUnit and Mockito** for testing.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps outlined below.

## Prerequisites

- **Java 11 or higher**: Ensure you have the appropriate Java version installed.
- **MySQL**: Set up a MySQL database for the project to use.
- **Maven**: For building and managing dependencies.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
   https://github.com/smruti12344/Job_Portal/tree/main
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd advanced-java-project
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    mvn install
    ```

## Configuration

Configure the application by setting up environment variables or modifying configuration files in the `src/main/resources` directory.

1. **Database Configuration**: Update the `application.properties` or equivalent configuration file with your MySQL database connection details such as URL, username, and password.

2. **Tomcat Server Configuration**: Deploy the application to the Apache Tomcat server by copying the WAR file to the `webapps` folder.

## Usage

1. **Build the project**:
    ```bash
    mvn clean package
    ```

2. **Deploy the project**:
    Copy the generated WAR file from the `target` folder to the `webapps` folder of your Apache Tomcat server.

3. **Start the Apache Tomcat server** and access the application at `http://localhost:8080/your-app-name` or the specified context path.

## Testing

The project includes unit and integration tests. Run the tests using the following command:

```bash
mvn test
